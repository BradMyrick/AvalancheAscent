# Marketplace Contract

The `Marketplace` contract facilitates the buying, selling, and trading of cards between players in the Avalanche Ascent game. It interacts with the `Card` and `Pack` contracts to enable secure and efficient card transactions.

## Features

- Listing cards for sale
- Purchasing listed cards
- Cancelling listings
- Offering trades (1-for-1, multiple-for-1, multiple-for-multiple)
- Accepting trades
- Cancelling trades
- Buying packs and decks from the team

## TODO

1. **Access Control**:
   - Implement role-based access control for critical functions like setting fees and managing disputes.
   - Consider using OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` contract for granular permission management.

2. **Escrow Functionality**:
   - Implement an escrow system to hold cards and funds during trades until both parties confirm the transaction.
   - This ensures a secure and trustless trading process.

3. **Royalty Fees**:
   - Implement a royalty fee system for card sales, allowing card creators to earn a percentage of the sale price.
   - This incentivizes content creators and supports the game ecosystem.

4. **Auction Mechanism**:
   - Implement an auction system alongside the fixed-price listings.
   - This allows for more dynamic pricing and enables players to bid on rare or highly sought-after cards.

5. **Batch Transactions**:
   - Optimize gas usage by implementing batch functions for creating multiple listings or accepting multiple trades in a single transaction.
   - This improves efficiency and reduces overall transaction costs for users.

6. **Pagination and Filtering**:
   - Implement pagination and filtering options for retrieving listings and trades.
   - This enhances the user experience and enables efficient navigation of large datasets.

7. **Front-running Protection**:
   - Implement measures to prevent front-running attacks, such as using a commit-reveal scheme or a time-locked transaction mechanism.
   - This ensures fair and equitable access to listings and trades.

8. **Event Logging**:
   - Emit comprehensive events for all significant actions within the marketplace.
   - This facilitates off-chain monitoring, analytics, and integration with external systems.

9. **Emergency Stop**:
   - Implement an emergency stop mechanism to pause the marketplace in case of critical issues or vulnerabilities.
   - This allows for quick mitigation of potential risks and protects user assets.

10. **Upgradability**:
    - Design the contract with upgradability in mind, allowing for future enhancements and bug fixes without disrupting the existing marketplace.
    - Consider using a proxy pattern or a contract migration strategy.
