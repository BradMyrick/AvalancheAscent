# Avalanche Ascent

###  1: Introduction

"Avalanche Ascent" is a trading card game  (TCG) built on the Avalanche subnet, leveraging its scalability, security, and decentralization. The main goal of the game is to ascend the mountain before the avalanche, providing a thrilling and engaging gameplay experience.

###  2: Tokenization of Game Assets

Each card in the game is tokenized as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the Avalanche blockchain. This gives players true ownership of their cards, allowing them to buy, sell, or trade them freely. This tokenization of game assets is a key feature of "Avalanche Ascent," providing a unique and immersive gaming experience.

###  3: Game Economy

"Avalanche Ascent" operates on a play-to-earn model, where players can earn tokens by playing the game. These tokens can be used to purchase card packs from the store, adding a rewarding and competitive element to the game. The game also features a marketplace where players can trade their cards with others, fostering a dynamic and interactive game economy.

###  4: Narrative

In the heart of the Avalanche chain, a mountainous landscape of opportunity and challenge awaits. Welcome to "Avalanche Ascent," a game where the thrill of the climb and the peril of the descent are as real as the tokens you earn.

In this world, players are mountaineers, each with their unique abilities and tools, embarking on a journey to conquer the highest peak of the Avalanche chain. The goal is simple yet daunting: ascend the mountain and trigger the avalanche to wipe out the competition. But remember, the mountain is treacherous, and the avalanche, once triggered, spares no one in its path.

The game is built on the Avalanche blockchain, harnessing its high transactions-per-second and sub-second finality to provide a seamless gameplay experience. The Avalanche subnets allow for personalized gaming blockchains, enabling a player-owned economy where players can earn real-world value from their in-game activities and digital assets.

The narrative of "Avalanche Ascent" is deeply intertwined with its tokenomic design. The tokens you earn are not just points; they are tools for survival and progress. They can be used to buy equipment, hire guides, or even form alliances. The more you ascend, the more tokens you earn, creating a compelling incentive to reach the top.

The community is the lifeblood of "Avalanche Ascent." Players can form teams, strategize together, and even save each other from the avalanche. The community is not just about competition; it's about cooperation and survival in the face of the mountain's wrath.

"Avalanche Ascent" is more than a game; it's a test of strategy, endurance, and courage. It's a journey that will push you to your limits and reward you beyond your expectations. So, gear up, brace yourself, and embark on the adventure of a lifetime. The mountain is calling, and the avalanche is waiting.

###  5: Solidity Smart Contract Structure

The game is built using Solidity smart contracts. These contracts handle various aspects of the game, including the creation of new cards, card packs, and the game's tokens, as well as the buying, selling, and trading of cards, the game's mechanics, and the distribution of basic lands to new wallets. Each of these contracts interacts with each other to create a seamless gaming experience.

###  6: Development Plan

The development plan for "Avalanche Ascent" is divided into five phases: Design and Planning, Development, Testing and Auditing, Deployment, and Marketing and Launch. This plan provides a comprehensive approach to developing a Web3 game based on Magic: The Gathering on the Avalanche subnets, including tokenization of game assets, creating a compelling narrative, and developing smart contracts.

###  7: Conclusion

"Avalanche Ascent" is a unique and engaging decentralized card game built on the Avalanche subnet. With its tokenized game assets, play-to-earn model, compelling narrative, and robust smart contract structure, it offers a thrilling and rewarding gaming experience. We invite you to join us on this exciting journey to ascend the mountain and trigger the avalanche!

## Development Plan
1. **Phase 1: Design and Planning** - Define the game mechanics, narrative, and economy. Design the smart contracts and the project folder layout.

2. **Phase 2: Development** - Develop the smart contracts using Solidity. Test the contracts using Truffle or another Ethereum development framework.

3. **Phase 3: Testing and Auditing** - Conduct thorough testing of the smart contracts to ensure they work as expected. Have the contracts audited by a third party to ensure their security.

4. **Phase 4: Deployment** - Deploy the smart contracts to the Avalanche subnet.

5. **Phase 5: Marketing and Launch** - Market the game to potential players and launch the game.

## Smart Contracts

### Card.sol

This contract will handle the creation of new cards. Each card will be an NFT, represented by a unique token on the blockchain. The contract will use the ERC1155 standard for creating gaming NFTs.

### Pack.sol

This contract will handle the creation of card packs. Players can purchase these packs using the game's tokens. The contract will interact with the Token.sol contract to ensure the player has enough tokens, and then with the Card.sol contract to generate the new cards.

### Token.sol

This contract will handle the game's tokens. Players can earn these tokens by playing the game and use them to purchase card packs. The contract will use the ERC20 standard for creating fungible tokens.

### Marketplace.sol

This contract will handle the buying, selling, and trading of cards. It will ensure that transactions are secure and transparent. The contract will interact with the Card.sol contract to transfer ownership of cards. 

### Gameplay.sol

This contract will handle the game's mechanics, such as card battles. It will interact with the Card.sol contract to determine the outcome of battles. The contract will also handle the game's main goal: ascending the mountain before the avalanche.

### Wallet.sol

This contract will handle the distribution of basic lands to new wallets. It will interact with the Card.sol contract to create the basic lands and the Token.sol contract to distribute the lands to new wallets.
