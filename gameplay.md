Based on the Magic: The Gathering card types, here's a 1:1 conversion for your mountain climbing game on the Avalanche blockchain:

1. **Climbers (Creatures)**: These are the main characters that players use to climb the mountain and avoid the avalanche. Each climber has unique abilities and characteristics, such as speed, strength, or agility. These could be represented as NFTs on the Avalanche blockchain, giving players true ownership of their characters.

2. **Gear (Enchantments)**: These cards represent equipment or supplies that provide lasting effects on the game. They remain in the player's inventory and their effects last as long as they are in play. This could include items like ropes, ice axes, or crampons.

3. **Actions (Instants)**: These cards represent immediate actions that can be taken at any time, even during an opponent's turn. They could include actions like dodging a falling rock, finding a shortcut, or helping a fellow climber.

4. **Plans (Sorceries)**: These cards represent strategic plans that can only be played during the player's own turn when the path is clear. Like actions, they have an immediate effect and are then discarded. This could include plans like setting up a camp, mapping a route, or predicting the weather.

5. **Tools (Artifacts)**: These are items that represent special tools or devices. They remain in the player's inventory and their effects last as long as they are in play. This could include tools like a compass, a map, or a satellite phone.

6. **Rest Stops (Lands)**: These cards are the main source of energy, the resource used to play most other cards. Rest stops could provide players with the energy needed to continue their climb.

7. **Guides (Planeswalkers)**: These are experienced climbers that a player can call on for assistance. Each has a set of abilities that can be used to affect the game, such as knowledge of the mountain, survival skills, or first aid abilities.

8. **Emergencies (Interrupts)**: These cards represent sudden events or emergencies that require immediate attention. They could include events like a sudden storm, a rockslide, or an equipment failure.
